# QuickUnityTools
A bunch of scripts I use when working with Unity to do things faster! (Handy for game jams!)

It's about time I finally made a submodule out of all the scripts I have lying around...
Feel free to use any of these scripts in your games. A reference would be apperciated but it's not necessary.

This stuff might change without notice as I add new tools and improve any APIs...
I'll be creating documention whenever it's convenient, but feel free to ask me about these scripts on Twitter: @adamgryu

Happy Game Development :)
